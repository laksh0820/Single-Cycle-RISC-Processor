# üßÆ Single-Cycle RISC Processor

## üìò Overview

This project outlines the architecture and functionality of a custom Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) integrated with a Control Unit and Data Path. It defines a specialized instruction set architecture (ISA) supporting R-type, I-type, J-type, memory, and branch operations.

The design encompasses:
- Custom instruction encoding
- Register-level ALU operation
- Memory access and conditional branching
- Modular control signal flow

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### üîß ALU
Performs arithmetic and logical operations using the instruction function field.

### üß† Control Unit
Generates control signals based on opcode and function field to manage the data path.

### üõ§Ô∏è Data Path
Connects all components (registers, ALU, memory) allowing instruction execution and data manipulation.
